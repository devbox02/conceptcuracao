                <h1>Does your business need a website in 2017?</h1>
                <hr>
                <p>Hi, Welcome to the business blog. <br>Sometimes when approaching new clients, we get questions like: “Do I still need websites for my business?” or “Do I really need a website if I already have a Facebook page?”. A website is essential for your business, no matter how good you are doing on facebook or other social media.</p>
                <h3>Here are the reasons why a website is essential for your business:</h3>
                <h2>Owning a website shows professionalism and credibility.</h2>
                <p>More and more consumers use the internet to search for products and services. Consumers expect to find your business online. If you don’t have an established online presence, customers can’t find you. Not showing up on google is one of the fastest ways to lose credibility as a business. It makes you and your company look out of touch and untrustworthy. Without a website potential customers will go to your competitors that do. Customers understand that a website is a serious investment. It shows that your business is here to stay.</p>
                <h2>Your website is your platform.</h2>
                <p>When you own your website, you are in control of both the content you produce and the platform you maintain. It is a risk to rely solely on third-party platforms like facebook. You are at their mercy. Do you remember Facebook 10 years ago? Do you remember Instagram 5 years ago? Social Media platforms are always changing. They are also limited. Let’s take a look at facebook, branding-wise you are limited to a profile picture, a cover and an about section. You also play by Facebook rules. They can close your account, change their policies, or change their algorithm influencing your ability to connect with your customers. By building your own website, you ensure complete control of you online destiny.</p>
                <h2>Communicate effectively with no limitations.</h2>
                <p>Your website communicates with customers 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. Providing information to your customers takes time, whether it is on the phone, face-to-face, in a brochure, or in emails. Think of your website as your online brochure or catalogue. You can provide lots of information about your products and services and help customers make a purchase decision. Use as many image, video and link to external sources you need. Also, it is much easier to update information about your products and services on your website than in print material, making it an effective way of letting your customers know about the arrival of new products, upcoming events, special promotions, or any new services you now offer.</p>
                <h2>Your website is the anchor for your marketing.</h2>
                <p>A website is essential your online marketing strategy. You need a website for SEO. A professionally built website will increase the visibility of your site to the search engines that people use to find what they are looking for. Also, all business details, product information and promotions should live on your website. Print advertising is static, while the web is dynamic (You can always update your website). On social media your promotional posts can get buried in the timeline, on your website you decide what is important and what comes first.</p><br>
                <div class="well">
                <p>Your website is your platform where customers can learn more about your company, research product information and determine if they want to do business with you. It’s fundamental tool that every company needs.
